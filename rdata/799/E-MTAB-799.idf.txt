Experiment Description	The Toxicogenomics Project was a 5-year collaborative project (2002-2007) by a consortium comprising the Japanese government and several pharmaceutical companies. The project produced the 'ToxicoGenomics project-Genomics Assisted Toxicity Evaluation system' (TG-GATEs), a large-scale database of transcriptomics and pathology data potentially useful for predicting the toxicity of new chemical entities. Conventional in vivo toxicology data was collected from single dose and repeat dosing studies on rats, and gene expression measured for the liver (and kidney in some cases). To provide information on species differences, gene expression was also measured in rat and human hepatocytes treated with the chemicals in vitro. Approximately 130 chemicals, primarily medicinal compounds, were tested at multipe doses. Gene expression was analysed using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. The gene expression data has been submitted in four parts: in vivo single dose, in vivo repeat dosing (E-MTAB-800), in vitro rat (E-MTAB-797) and in vitro human (E-MTAB-798). This submission comprises the in vivo, single dose studies. If publishing results based on this data, please cite the full project name 'Toxicogenomics Project and Toxicogenomics Informatics Project', the database name 'Open TG-GATEs' and the URL 'http://toxico.nibio.go.jp'. Please note that the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) was not involved in the Toxicogenomics Project in any way, acting only to submit the transcriptomics data to Array Express.

Protocol Description	Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Japan Inc. at 5 weeks of age. Animals were given a 7 day quarantine and acclimatization period. The rats were divided into groups of 5 using a computerized stratified random grouping method based on the body weight for each age. The animals were individually housed in stainless-steel cages in a room with 12 hours lighting (7:00-19:00) daily, ventilated with an air-change 15 times per hour, maintained at 21-25C, relative humidity 40-70%. Each animal was allowed free access to water and pellet food (CRF-1, sterilized by radiation, Oriental Yeast Co., Japan).	Each compound was administered at four different dose levels; control (vehicle only), low, middle and high. The highest dose for each compound was determined in a one-week dose-finding study, and 1/3 and 1/10 of that were set as the middle and low doses. For administration via oral gavage, compounds were dissolved in 0.5% methylcellulose solution or suspended in corn oil depending on their dispersibility. Compounds requiring intravenous administration were dissolved in saline or 5% glucose solution. Rats in each group were administered a single dose of compound.  Animals were sacrificed at 3, 6, 9 and 24 hours after dosing.	Animals were euthanized by exsanguination from the abdominal artery under ether anesthesia. Immediately after sacrifice, a 30 mg aliquot of the left lateral lobe of the liver and of the kidney was put into RNAlater (Ambion) for expression profiling. Other data obtained from each animal include body weight, liver and kidney weights, clinical chemistry, hematology, general symptoms and a histopathological examination of the liver and kidney.	Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Kit by BioRobot 3000 (Qiagen) 	Microarray analysis was carried out on 3 out of 5 samples. The procedure was carried out according to manufacturers instrucions using SuperScript Choice System (Invitrogen) and  T7-(dT)24 oligonucleotide primer (Affymetrix) for cDNA synthesis, cDNA Cleanup Module (Affymetrix) for purification and BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo Diagnostics) for synthesis of biotin-labelled cRNA.	10 ug of fragmented cRNA was hybridized to the probe array for 18 h at 45C at 60 rpm, after which the array was washed and stained by streptavidin-phycoerythrin using Fluidics Station 400 (Affymetrix) and scanned by Gene Array Scanner (Affymetrix).
