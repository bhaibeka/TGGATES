Experiment Description	The Toxicogenomics Project was a 5-year collaborative project (2002-2007) by a consortium comprising the Japanese government and several pharmaceutical companies. The project produced the 'Toxicogenomics Project-Genomics Assisted Toxicity Evaluation system' (TG-GATEs), a large-scale database of transcriptomics and pathology data potentially useful for predicting the toxicity of new chemical entities. Conventional in vivo toxicology data was collected from single dose and repeat dosing studies on rats, and gene expression measured for the liver (and kidney in some cases). To provide information on species differences, gene expression was also measured in rat and human hepatocytes treated with the chemicals in vitro. Approximately 130 chemicals, primarily medicinal compounds, were tested at multipe doses. Gene expression was analysed using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. The gene expression data has been submitted in four parts: in vivo single dose (E-MTAB-799), in vivo repeat dosing (E-MTAB-800), in vitro rat  (E-MTAB-797) and in vitro human. This submission comprises the in vitro human studies. If publishing results based on this data, please cite the full project name 'Toxicogenomics Project and Toxicogenomics Informatics Project', the database name 'Open TG-GATEs' and the URL 'http://toxico.nibio.go.jp'. Please note that the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) was not involved in the Toxicogenomics Project in any way, acting only to submit the transcriptomics data to Array Express.

Protocol Description	Cryopreserved human hepatocytes were thawed, washed twice with medium (L15 medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin and 10% fetal bovin serum) and seeded at a cell density of 1.2 x10^6 cells/well. Following an attachment period of 3 hr, the medium was replaced and kept overnight before drug exposure at 37C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.	Each compound was administered at four different dose levels; control (vehicle only), low, middle and high. In general, the highest concentration was 10-20% of the lethal concentration as estimated by LDH leakage over 24 hours. When the cells could tolerate 10 mM or the level equal to the solubility limit the highest concentration was set to that value. The middle and lowest concentrations were set to 1/5 and 1/25 respectively of the highest. Test compounds were added to the medium directly or as a 1,000X stock solution in DMSO. Cells were exposed to compound for 2, 8 and 24 hr before collection.	After compound exposure, the hepatocytes were lysed with RLT buffer and collected for expression profiling. Cell viability was assesssed by LDH release and DNA content. 	Total RNA was isolated from the hepatocyte lysate using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).	Labeling was carried out according to manufacturers instrucions using SuperScript Choice System (Invitrogen) and  T7-(dT)24 oligonucleotide primer (Affymetrix) for cDNA synthesis cDNA Cleanup Module (Affymetrix) for purification and BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo Diagnostics) for synthesis of biotin-labelled cRNA.	10 ug of fragmented cRNA was hybridized to the probe array for 18 h at 45C at 60 rpm, after which the array was washed and stained by streptavidin-phycoerythrin using Fluidics Station 400 (Affymetrix) and scanned by Gene Array Scanner (Affymetrix).
